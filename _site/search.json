    "text": "Hello! I am a first-year biostatistics MSc student and bioinformatician with a strong background in the Health Sciences. I am pursuing the field of statistical genomics to combine my passion for statistical methods with my love of cellular biology, and to build on my 2 years of experience analyzing high-throughput data with Python, R, and Bash. I especially enjoy teaching; I have spent 6 semesters as a Teaching Assistant in McMasterâ€™s Faculty of Health Sciences, taught the General Chemistry section of 10 MCAT prep courses with The Princeton Review, and ran 14 review sessions for lower-year courses to assist younger Health Sciences students."
